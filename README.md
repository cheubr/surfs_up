# surfs_up

# Overview of the analysis:
    The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the surf 
    and ice cream shop business is sustanible year-round.


# Results: 
    ![June_Temps](https://github.com/cheubr/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/JuneTemps.PNG)
    ![Dec_Temps](https://github.com/cheubr/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/DecTemps.PNG)

    1. June has a higher Max temperature.
        June: 85 degrees
        December: 83 degrees

    2. December has the lowest Minimum temperature. 
        December: 56 degrees 
        June: 64 degrees

    3. The average temperatures of the two months are very simliar.
        June: 78 degrees
        December: 71 degrees

# Summary: 
    The difference of temperatures in Hawaii from June compared to December is surprisingly similar.
    There is not much variace in temperature between the two months.
    Generally across the board at all percentiles the difference was around 3 degrees, 
        which actually fall within the standard diviation for both months.
    The largest variance in temperature is the minimum temp, with a difference of 10 degrees.
    With the temperature being so stable having a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable
        year round if it was based on temperature.
    Realistically sustainiblity of the business would depend on the levels of tourism year round.
    Two other queriees I would include to give us a better picture would be,
        Precipitation, and Swells.
    Precipitation becuase typically people do not surf when its raining.
    There may be a few months with alot of rainfall.
    Swells to forcast the waves, because there is not much surfing during calm seas.
